gphoto2 2.4.10

 * Event loop handling non-waitevent able cameras.

 * --capture-movie (optional arguments: frames, or seconds)
   now loops over preview capture as fast as possible
   and writes the frames continously.

   The resulting file is "MotionJPEG" and can be postprocessed
   or displayed (by mplayer).

   Also output to stdout is possible for pipeing like:
	   gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | someotherprogram
